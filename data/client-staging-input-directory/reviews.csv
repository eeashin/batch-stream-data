1489424,8123022,2013-10-16,4786919,Sharon,"Glad to be back for a second time in my cozy room, comfy bed, personable and friendly hosts. It was great to have that coffee made for me in the morning before I was off again. "
1489424,8279957,2013-10-23,8362214,Andrej,"We stayed only for a night, so can not tell much about the area. Upon our quite late arrival, the family was still up and were busy with home beer preparation. It seemed that own business took all their attention, so we kind of felt on our own. Basement where we stayed was spacious, but quite messy, all things spread around, especially in the adjacent rooms. The room itself and the shower was ok; one can stay overnight there."
1489424,8303182,2013-10-24,9458270,Andreia,I had a pleasant stay here. The bed was indeed very comfortable (I wish I could have one like that at home). Efrat and her husband went above and beyond my expectations. Very grateful!
1489424,8342905,2013-10-26,2220644,J Mase,"I was in town to do some work at U Albany. Not only was this an amazingly friendly place to stay, the house is about 7 minutes driving to the university! I would definitely recommend staying here and most certainly will stay here if I am in town again! Clean space and Efrat is a very warm person and even invited my colleagues in for a quick chat before we headed out on the town!

They are very welcoming, and let you interact as much or little as you'd like, and have many book recommendations if you are so interested. Good people. "

Efrat and Dan were great hosts, offering me tea and some really delicious Turkish coffee. It was also very convenient to where I had to go in Albany (about a ten minute drive). I would recommend it to anyone traveling in the Albany area."

Levy was a great host, the room was the perfect size and its only a 10 minute walk from buses that take you into the heart of downtown Albany. They even have their own home-brewed beer! Neighborhood is a sleepy one near the SUNY campus, good for long walks or a job if you were prefer. "

1489424,18180444,2014-08-23,17956894,Helen,Dan welcomed us and drove us to a nearby diner for tea then spent time taking us to a shop to get supplies. Very pleasant and likeable gentleman. We saw less of Efrat but she was pleasant and welcoming too. The bed was comfy and we slept well. The room was adequate for our needs and the hosts were helpful. Very much a family home but we didn't mind that at all. It would be nice to have a small lock on the bathroom door just for a sense  of privacy... But not a big deal . Lovely couple . Enjoyed our stay very much . Thanks . X <br/>
1489424,18448279,2014-08-26,2500569,Ruth,"Efrat and Dan were incredibly welcoming and kind. They have a laid back home where you can jump right in on life. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly. It was very convenient to access the major roadways. Washington park and the Hudson river were a short drive away which made for fun exploring with lovely walkways and bike paths. 
<br/>Overall I would highly recommend staying with Efrat and Dan for a chill and homey experience."

<br/>They were warm and friendly and made me feel welcome in their house.
<br/>The house is on a dead end street so not a lot of city noise and is not far from the colleges. The space was exactly what I was looking for. 
<br/>Thank you for the hospitality and I hope you have space available next time I visit Albany.
<br/>Thank you
<br/>David"

The place is a little bit far from where I needed to go during the days since I don't have a car, and they helped me get around as much as they can. If you are driving here to stay, then there would not be a problem. The bed was comfy and bathroom was clean, just as shown on the pictures. Overall the stay was great."

She warned the bed tended to make people sleep in because of how comfortable it is-- she's not lying! The house is very convenient to Western Ave,  which has access to a major bus line that can take you all the way to the train station. I highly recommend and would be happy to stay again. "

The bed was as comfy as advertised, the neighborhood lovely and peaceful, and all in all it was a great way to wind down after a long day of test taking in downtown Albany. Getting a room with Dan and Efrat was definitely the right decision -- far better than staying at some overpriced hotel downtown -- and I would recommend it to anyone in visiting the Albany area. I  regret only that I didn't have a bit more time to spend with my hosts. "

<br/>The room is very clean, spacious and the bed is SUPER comfortable! It is not an exaggeration! All amenities were available as listed. 
<br/>
<br/>They took me out for dinner once, to a grocery store and helped me move all of my luggage to the apartment I found. Not all Airbnb hosts would offer such extra help. 
<br/>
<br/>More than just a place to sleep, a cultural experience and friendship if you seek for it. Definitely worth your money. Has my recommendation. "
1489424,44540687,2015-08-27,14890411,Jolein,"Efrat and Dan are very kind people. I had send both a textmessage when I arrived at Collins Circle and eventhough Dan read it half an hour later, he picked me up in the middle of nowhere (that was how I felt). Also they took me out for dinner to a typical American dining place. It was my first full day in Albany and staying at Efrat and Dan's was a great experience. "
1489424,45179258,2015-08-31,32758273,Jaroslav,Staying at Efrat's place was rally great and friendly.

1489424,56893626,2015-12-19,12499511,Max,Efrat was out of town when I stayed but her husband Dan let me in the house and showed me the room. Looked exactly as on the website and in the listing. WiFi was excellent. Private bathroom with towels and shampoo provided. This is basically their house and they are happy to let you use as much as you want. I was only there 1 night so it was a quick stay. Convenient to Albany Medical Center.
1489424,57588955,2015-12-27,50816810,Donald,"This was my first experience with Airbnb.  Good communication preceded my stay, making me comfortable that my plans were synchronized with my hosts.

Efrat had good communication with us to plan our stay and they were okay with our late checkin which helped us out. Unfortunately we were so exhausted from our day we went straight to bed and but in the morning Dan was helpful with breakfast recommendations.

<br/>The neighborhood was pleasant and easily accessible to the airport.  
<br/>A good short term place to stay if your needs are closer to a hostel than a Bed and Breakfast."

1489424,83864087,2016-07-04,81183358,Moshe,"Efrat and Dan were great hosts. They were accommodating, helpful, and very welcoming. Would stay again!"
1489424,84389194,2016-07-07,18471531,Breanne,"Efrat and Dan were very friendly. As they said they will visit with you as much or little as you would like. Got a lot of rest in their extra comfy bed. They have excellent recommendations for local eateries and books, books everywhere to read. Proximal to local buses and in a safe and quiet neighborhood this place is great.  "
1489424,85106116,2016-07-10,81710491,Mitchell,"Efrat and Dan were very welcoming and nice.  The house, while older, is well kept and is in a good neighborhood. The room was clean and comfortable."
1489424,86466505,2016-07-16,3054047,Arianne,"This was my second stay with Efrat and Dan, and honestly, I was equally as excited to see them as I was to see the people I was ostensibly in town to visit. Efrat and Dan feel like family to me and they are thoughtful, lovely hosts. The house was clean and homey as always, and this time they raised the bar by playing with my kiddos. They're fun conversationalists. You should stay here. "
1489424,87986733,2016-07-22,83924457,Heliana,Efrat and her family were really nice to us. Even though we stayed just one night we got to share some time with them. The room is clean and the bed is comfortable. 
1489424,89412228,2016-07-28,10707089,Sebastien,"Very welcoming, gave me the space I needed to do my bar prep. I had basically the basement to myself."
1489424,97792181,2016-08-28,26272790,Olin & Alilia,"It's a lovely neighborhood. We were happy Dan and Efrat openened their home to us with only a couple of days notice. We enjoyed our stay in Albany. I would stay with them again. We didn't have a lot of time to visit with them this trip. We had the basement to ourselves and I enjoyed using their exercise machine in the morning. We were able to store things in their fridge and freezer, and warm up our waffles in their toaster oven. They have a cute little free library in the front of their yard. I look forward to getting to know them better if we have an opportunity to stay in Albany again. May God bless you for your hospitality."
1489424,98360398,2016-08-30,54727266,Peter,"Such a nice place, and such nice people! Efrat was very flexible as to arrival time. The room I'd originally wanted was taken, so they offered me their palatial basement instead. The basement is large, beautiful, and extremely quiet. Efrat and Dan were also a joy to visit with, and they gave me lots of useful info about the surrounding area. Thanks so much!"
1489424,99923226,2016-09-06,15598027,Karen,"Wonderful stay with Efrat and Dan. <br/>My friend and I stayed for one night in their cozy basement. Very comfortable. Nice, clean bathroom. They setup an extra bed for us, which was great. Would definitely stay again. "
1489424,100481382,2016-09-09,55480865,Maurice,"Really enjoyed getting to know these wonderful people. The bed was comfortable. I had the whole basement to myself, which was great. They were happy to converse and hang out and I felt very at home. "
1489424,102273409,2016-09-17,31821388,Yuki,Dan was very kind and friendly. I was happy to meet him.

1489424,107188721,2016-10-09,8997559,Alayne,Quiet and safe neighborhood. Efrat and Dan were accommodating even though we arrived a little later than we anticipated. The room is in the basement where we had our own room and own bathroom as well. We slept so well that we actually overslept the next morning! We had great conversation with Dan and Efrat as well. We will definitely be back :)
1489424,107429114,2016-10-10,48958045,Vadim,"The best thing about Efrat and Dan's place is that you get the whole bottom floor with a very specious bedroom and toilet+shower so the stay is very private. Bed feels like you're sleeping on a cloud. Efrat and Dan were very kind but we didn't get to speak to them much as we arrived late and left early. Location was easy for us (we were driving and parking is plentiful in the street but can't say how it is if you aren't driving). Ony thing to consider, which might not be OK for everyone is that you do get a sense that it is somebody's house. That is,  the area you live in is not as tidy as a museum. But it is clean, comfortable and home-like, just something to consider if you are looking for a hotel-like experience. We had a great time and definitely recommend the stay."
1489424,109443156,2016-10-21,81332720,Marilyn,"LOCATION WAS GREAT, LIKED THAT THERE WAS A BATHROOM DOWNSTAIRS. FAMILY WAS VERY FRIENDLY AND ACCOMADATING. NICE QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD"

1489424,121698052,2016-12-18,104279343,Valerie,We really enjoyed staying here. We were able to pick up the key at our convenience so we could come and go as needed. Efrat  and Dan were very welcoming and had no problems with us bringing our 9 mo old son. We had the whole bottom level to ourselves which included a bathroom and living area.

1489424,165648709,2017-07-01,3054047,Arianne,"Efrat and Dan are the best. Their house is my second home when visiting my family in Albany. They are dependable and friendly, and always up for a sharp, meandering chat--though also just as happy to let us go to bed early. They are also fantastic with children, and truly enjoy them. Stay here!"

Dan offered to make us coffee in the morning.  Very cozy and nice room.  Let us into their home even when they weren't home and gave us a house key to come back when we needed to.  No complaints at all.
1489424,190148326,2017-09-03,22523041,Jacques,Ma femme et avons bien aimé l'accueil de Dan et Efrat. Le lit est très confortable. L'emplacement est très bien car c'est tout près de l'autoroute.

1489424,198499635,2017-09-29,111328963,Nathan,"The house was very easy to find and right off the highway and close to the airport if you find yourself flying to or from Albany NY. They were very gracious and let us check-in late in the evening. There was fresh sheets on the bed, fresh towels and a hot shower. I would highly recommend to stay there if you are in the area."
1489424,201562507,2017-10-08,56877591,Dana,Efrat and Dan were lovely hosts! My roommates and I felt at home even during our short trip to Albany.

"

The basement room was well-lit and had comfortable bedding. There was a tv in the cozy living space that we didn't get a chance to use. The water pressure in the shower was enough to wash away the stresses of traveling all day. I would book again if I was in the Albany area! Also grabbed a souvenir from the free library stand that's right outside their house.

We didn't meet Efrat this time but her husband was so helpful and recommended a new south Indian (dosa) restaurant a 5 minute drive away and we loved it.

They were very understanding, and had no problem with late check-in. They met us at the door and introduced us to the family. Very comfortable and warm household.

Their communication was very clear. I had to arrive late at night, and they accommodated my request and were waiting for me too. <br/>Dan and Efrat are well-traveled and have such worldly knowledge that you will learn a lot by talking to them. Albany is very charming, and their place is so peaceful. I had a very good stay. They give you privacy if you want, and if you want to chat in the evening, they are very welcoming. I would definitely stay here again if I came to Albany. They are very responsive hosts; if you see this place in the listing, do take up on it. You will have a delightful stay."

They had 2 comfy beds in the room, but the smaller bed had an extra plushy topper that made it feel like sleeping on a cloud.  I also appreciated the warm fuzzy blanket that was made available to me.  The hosts were the by far the most easy going in my travels; talking to Dan felt more like talking to a good buddy I’ve known for years rather than a stranger.  iWould stay here again."
